# NBA_Analytics (In Progress)

Who are the top undervalued players based on their court position that are currently playing in the NBA? How would they perform if we had such a fictional starting five roster? Using the NBA REST API and web scraping Basketball Reference, we try to assemble an undervalued all-star starting five team and predict their winning shares. The idea is based off the book/movie Moneyball from Michael Lewis. This project just aims to have fun coding and applying analytics to basketball.
